Family Guy Shorts - Episode 02 (Relationship Workflow)
Format: SPEAKER|TAGS|LYRICS
PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, excited|Stewie! I got tired of my girlfriend shouting at me for not sending I miss you messages, so I built this workflow that automates everything.
STEWIE|male, high, speech, clear, british|You've automated romantic communication? The man who thinks I love you is just three random words is now engineering relationships through workflows?
PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, confident|Yes, and it sends I miss you every single hour. Then it remembers her mother, father, even her dad's birthday, so she has no reason to complain. Last but not least, if you're tired of talking to her, you can replace yourself with this AI agent that has access to all your previous chats. Your messages will sound just like you.
STEWIE|male, high, speech, clear, skeptical|Replace yourself? You've built a digital boyfriend substitute trained on your conversation history? That's not automation, that's relationship fraud.
PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, final|Exactly. This workflow will make you boyfriend material. If you want this for your girlfriend, just go through my description. I have shared there.
