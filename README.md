# 🎬 Peter & Stewie Video Maker

Generate **Family Guy short videos** (Instagram Reels) with AI-cloned voices of Peter and Stewie Griffin.

Uses **MOSS-TTS 1.7B** for zero-shot voice cloning on Google Colab (free), and **GitHub Actions** for automated video assembly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Launch the Voice AI on Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/0xSatwik/peter-video-maker-github/blob/main/learnwithperandstewie.ipynb)

1. Click the badge above to open the notebook
2. Go to **Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU**
3. Click **Runtime → Run all**
4. Wait ~5-8 minutes for the model to load
5. Copy the **public Gradio URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxxxxx.gradio.live`)

### Step 2: Generate the Video

1. Go to **[Actions](../../actions)** → **"Generate Family Guy Short"**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Paste your **Colab Gradio URL** in the first field
4. (Optional) Change the script file path
5. Click **"Run workflow"** and wait for completion
6. Download the video from the **Artifacts** section

## ✍️ Writing Scripts

Script format (`config/scripts/EPISODE_01.txt`):
```
SPEAKER|TAGS|DIALOGUE TEXT
```

Example:
```
peter|male, deep, speech|Hey Stewie, what are you doing?
stewie|male, high, speech|I'm plotting world domination, obviously.
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Colab** runs MOSS-TTS 1.7B (zero-shot voice cloning) and exposes a Gradio API
2. **GitHub Actions** sends each dialogue line to the Colab API with the matching voice reference
3. Generated audio clips are assembled into a 1080×1920 video with character images and captions
4. Final video is uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact
