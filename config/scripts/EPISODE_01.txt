PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, narrative|If you're still paying for AI voice cloners like ElevenLabs, you're literally burning money. Instead, use this one secret open-source model.

STEWIE|male, high, speech, clear, british|Peter, that sounds illegal or genius. Which is it?

PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, excited|Genius. It's called MOSS TTS. It gives you production-grade cloning for free, no credit card drama. It even gives you high-fidelity, zero-shot cloning straight from a Google Colab T4 GPU, including a 5-second sample to full voice clone.

STEWIE|male, high, speech, clear, skeptical|So, real cloning, not some toy demo?

PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, confident|Real cloning. It acts like a beast. It routes your audio through a specialized architecture. You can hit long-form dialogue, fast conversational models, and high-stability renders, all with zero cost.

STEWIE|male, high, speech, clear, curious|So I can prototype, build, and clone voices without paying a cent?

PETER|male, deep, speech, clear, final|Exactly. Same quality, better workflows, zero cost. If you want the link and the English tutorial, comment VOICE and I'll DM it to you. Or check the description if you're on YouTube, you lazy trolls.
