Here are 4 different preset combinations you can try in your Google Colab Gradio UI. 
You can copy these settings into the sliders shown in your screenshot to find the perfect Peter voice.

Once you test these and find the one you like best, just tell me which Preset # won, and I will update the code with those exact numbers!

### PRESET 1: "The Perfect Replica" (Highly Recommended)
This is the safest bet for zero-shot Voice Cloning. It locks the AI closely to your 10-second reference file.
- **Text Temp:** 0.7
- **Text Top-P:** 0.9
- **Text Top-K:** 40
- **Audio Temp:** 0.6     (Low audio temp keeps the voice sounding identical to the reference)
- **Audio Top-P:** 0.8
- **Audio Top-K:** 40
- **Rep Penalty:** 1.25

### PRESET 2: "The Screenshot Settings" (Expressive)
These are the settings from your screenshot. They allow the AI to be quite expressive, though the voice might fluctuate slightly.
- **Text Temp:** 1.7      (Very high! Makes the delivery very dramatic)
- **Text Top-P:** 1.0
- **Text Top-K:** 50
- **Audio Temp:** 0.55    (Good, stable value)
- **Audio Top-P:** 0.8
- **Audio Top-K:** 65
- **Rep Penalty:** 1.25

### PRESET 3: "Ultra Strict" (No Emotion)
Use this only if Preset 1 and 2 are still "hallucinating" or changing voices. This forces the model to mathematically clone the audio but might sound a bit robotic.
- **Text Temp:** 0.5
- **Text Top-P:** 0.7
- **Text Top-K:** 20
- **Audio Temp:** 0.4     (Extremely restricted)
- **Audio Top-P:** 0.7
- **Audio Top-K:** 20
- **Rep Penalty:** 1.4

### PRESET 4: "Storyteller" (Dynamic & Natural)
If you want Peter to sound like he's telling a great, animated story and you don't mind if the exact voice pitch fluctuates slightly, use this.
- **Text Temp:** 1.2
- **Text Top-P:** 0.9
- **Text Top-K:** 50
- **Audio Temp:** 0.75
- **Audio Top-P:** 0.9
- **Audio Top-K:** 50
- **Rep Penalty:** 1.15
